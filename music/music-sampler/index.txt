Page title: OneRepublic


OneRepublic is an American alternative rock band founded in 2002. The group was originally formed in 1996 by Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins during their senior year in high school under the name "This Beautiful Mess", and broke up the same year when the two went to separate colleges. The two reunited in 2002 in Los Angeles, where they reformed as "Republic". Nine months later, the group signed with Columbia records, changed their name to "OneRepublic", and began production of their first album.

In 2005, just a few months before the debut album was to be released, the band was dropped from Columbia records. As an unsigned band, they gained popularity through MySpace, and credit the website for keeping them together.

The popularity of the band's first single, "Apologize," caught the attention of a few labels, including Timbaland's Mosley Music Group. Soon after, OneRepublic would became the first rock band to sign with the label.

Dreaming Out Loud, the debut album OneRepublic had worked so hard to publish, was released on November 20, 2007. Five singles were released in total from the album, including "Apologize" (which had been released in 2005) and "Stop and Stare" which had the same success.

On November 17, 2007, the band released their second album, "Waking Up". Four singles were released from this album, including the leading single "All the Right Moves" and the equally popular second single "Secrets."

OneRepublic's most recent album, "Native", was released on March 26, 2013. Four singles were released from this album, including the worldwide hit "Counting Stars" and the leading single "If I Lose Myself."
