OneRepublic is an American alternative rock band founded in 2002. The group was originally formed in 1996 by Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins during their senior year in high school under the name "This Beautiful Mess", and broke up the same year when the two went to separate colleges. The two reunited in 2002 in Los Angeles, where the reformed as "Republic". Nine months later, the group signed with Columbia records, changed their name to "OneRepublic", and began production of their first album.

In 2005, just a few months before the debut album was to be released, the band was dropped from Columbia records. As an unsigned band, they gained popularity through MySpace, and credit the website for keeping them together. This popularity caught the attention of a few labels, including Timbaland's Mosley Music Group. OneRepublic quickly became the first rock band to sign on with Mosley Music Group.

Dreaming Out Loud, the debut album OneRepublic had waited to long to finish, was released on November 20, 2007.
