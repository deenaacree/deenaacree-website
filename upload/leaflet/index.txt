Like my father before me, I was raised in a small town in North Central Florida called Melrose. It is a small but thriving community that is situated right in the middle of four counties: Alachua, Bradford, Clay, and Putnam. Although the small-town charm of the community is evident through the historic sections of town and the families that have had roots in the area for generations, the town is well-known in the area for its art scene.

The small, unincorporated municipality boasts many art galleries,  weekly farmers markets, hosts three arts and crafts festivals annually, and has countless live music concerts, informal dances, and art shows throughout the year. In addition, the community is the home of many locally owned restaurants, family-oriented businesses, and a large number of churches.
